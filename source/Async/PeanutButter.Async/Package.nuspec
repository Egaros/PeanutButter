    <summary>
    A package to essentially wrap Task.Run and variants in a runner object which can
    be substituted. This allows your consuming code to be more easily tested, especially
    in conjunction with PeanutButter.TestUtils.Async, which provides a synchronous
    ITaskRunner so your tests don't have to have access to internally-used tasks
    or other artifacts but can just test as if the code under test is synchronous
